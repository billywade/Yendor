        primarily in subterranean lakes and rivers. An aboleth has a pink
        belly. Four pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body
        and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its
        tail for propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its
        tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.

        Aboleths speak their own language,
        as well as Undercommon and Aquan. """
