# Yendor
## An automatic, hackable dungeon master assistant

Yendor is the for the dungeon master who understands that a role-playing game is about a good time with friends, not perfect lore. Yendor takes care of creating monsters, items, NPCs, and a scenario so you can get down to playing, on the fly, without carrying around your weight in supporting books. Additionally, Yendor is free and open source, written in documented, easy-reading Python, so anyone can modify the theme and contents to match your group's play style.

Yendor is in **early** alpha. Expect many features to be missing or nonfunctional. PRs and suggestions are happily accepted!

Yendor is built to accommodate D20, high-fantasy settings, but can be modified to be useful in other settings. Additionally, if any scaling feels broken, let me know.

## Installation

Yendor has a few prerequisites. Make sure that Python 3 is installed, and then install PyQt5, either by pip or your package manager. After that, clone or download the repository and run `yendor.py`, and you're set!
